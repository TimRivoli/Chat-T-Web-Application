# StorageManager Class

This Python class manages interactions with Firebase, SQL, and handles various storage-related operations.

## Prerequisites

- Make sure you have the required Python modules installed:
  - `_classes.Constants`
  - `_classes.DataClasses`
  - `_classes.SQLManager`
  - `_classes.FirebaseManager`
  
## Usage

1. Import the necessary modules:
```python
from _classes.Constants import firebase_user_ID
from _classes.DataClasses import *
from _classes.SQLManager import SQLManager
from _classes.FirebaseManager import FirebaseManager
```

2. Create an instance of `StorageManager`:
```python
storage_mgr = StorageManager()
```

3. Use the available functions to interact with Firebase and SQL. For example:
```python
conversations = storage_mgr.get_conversation_list()
for conversation in conversations:
    print("Conversation:", conversation)
```

## Functions

- `__init__()`: Initializes the StorageManager, including SQLManager and FirebaseManager instances.

- `shut_down()`: Shuts down the SQLManager instance.

- ... (and more, see the code for additional functions)

## Important Notes

- Modify the class and functions as per your specific use case.

- This code is a sample and may require adjustments based on your application's requirements.
